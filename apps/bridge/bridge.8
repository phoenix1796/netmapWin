.Sh NAME
.Nm bridge
.Nd A netmap client to bridge two network interfaces (or one interface and the host stack).
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl i Ar port
.Op Fl b Ar batch size

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple netmap application that bridges packets between two netmap ports. If the two netmap
ports use the same netmap memory region
.Nm
operates in zero copy (unless explicitly prevented by the
.Fl c
flag).
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i Ar port
Name of the netmap port. It can be supplied up to two times to identifiy
the ports that must be bridged. Any netmap port type (physical interface, VALE switch, pipe, monitor port...)
can be used. If the option is supplied only once, then it must be
for a physical interface and, in that case,
.Nm
will bridge the port and the host stack.
.It Fl b Ar batch-size
Maximum number of packets to send in one operation.
.It Fl w Ar wait-link
indicates the number of seconds to wait before transmitting.
It defaults to 2, and may be useful when talking to physical
ports to let link negotiation complete before starting transmission.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose mode
.It Fl c
Disable zero-copy mode.
