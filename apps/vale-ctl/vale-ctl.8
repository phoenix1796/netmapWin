.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages VALE switches by attaching and detaching interfaces, creating
and deleting persistent VALE ports, starting and stopping polling mode.
.Pp
When issued without options it lists all the existing switch ports together
with their internal bridge number and port number.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ar vale-port
Print the number of receive rings of
.Ar vale-port.
.It Fl a Ar switch:interface
Attach the existing
.Ar interface
to
.Ar switch
and detach it from the host stack.
.It Fl h Ar switch:interface
Attach the existing
.Ar interface
to
.Ar switch
while keeping it attached to the host stack. More precisely, packets coming from
the host stack and directed to the interface will go through the switch, where
they can still reach the interface if the switch rules allow it. Conversely,
packets coming from the interface will go through the switch and, if appropriate,
will reach the host stack.
.It Fl d Ar switch:interface
Detach
.Ar interface
from
.Ar switch.
.It Fl n Ar interface
Create a new persistent VALE port with name
.Ar interface.
.It Fl d Ar interface
Destroy the persistent VALE port with name
.Ar inteface.
.It Fl l Ar switch:port
Show the internal bridge number and port number of the given switch port.
.It Fl p Ar interface
Start polling mode for
.Ar interface.
.It Fl P Ar interface
Stop polling mode for
.Ar interface.
.It Fl C Ar x | Ar x,y | Ar x,y,z | Ar x,y,z,w
When used in conjunction with
.Fl n
it supplies the number of tx and rx rings and slots. The full format with four numbers
gives, in order, numner of tx slots, number of rx slots, number of tx rings and number
of rx rings. The form with three numbers uses
.Ar z
for both the number of tx and the number of rx rings. The forms with less than two
numbers use the default values for the number of rings. 
The form with two numbers supplies the numbers of tx and rx slots. The form with only one number
uses
.Ar x
for both the number of tx and the number of rx slots.
.Pp
When used in conjunction with
.Fl p
only the first three forms are used. The first number may be either 0 or 1.
If 0, then all interface rings will be polled by a single thread, running
on the core id given by the second number (the third number, if present,
must be 1). If the first number is 1,
then the ring identified by the second number will be polled by
the core with the same id. If a third number is given, then this
is repeated for as many consecutive rings and cores.
.It Fl m Ar memid
Used in conjunction with
.Fl n
supplies the netmap memory region identifier to use together with the newly
created persistent VALE port. These ports use a private memory region by
default. Using this option you can let them share memory with other ports.
Pass 1 as
.Ar memid
to use the global memory region already shared by all
harware netmap ports.
